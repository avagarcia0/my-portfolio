      <h1>Ava Garcia's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Ava Garcia and I am a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon who is
      majoring in artificial intelligence. My interests include computer
      science, social choice theory, and video games. I am currently an intern
      at Google, which is the same company that my father works for.
