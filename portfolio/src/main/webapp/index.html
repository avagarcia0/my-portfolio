      <h1>Ava Garcia's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Ava Garcia and I am a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon who is majoring in artificial intelligence. I
        am currently working as an intern at Google, which is the same company that my father works for. Last year I
        worked on implementing a system that allows technicians to manage their workflows when repairing and replacing
        machines in Google's datacenters. This year, all my work will be open source and can be found at
        <a href="https://github.com/avagarcia0">my GitHub</a>. My interests include computer science, video games, and
        social choice theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        One cool concept in social choice theory is Voter Satisfaction Efficiency, or VSE for short. VSE is intended to
        act as a holistic measure of how well a voting method does at satisfying voter's preferences. However, because
        it is hard to get data from real-life elections and even harder to read people's minds to get their preferences,
        VSE is measured through simulated elections. The following is a graphic showing VSE results for a set of
        simulations conducted by Jameson Quinn:
