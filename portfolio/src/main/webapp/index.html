      <h1>Ava Garcia's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Ava Garcia and I am a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon who is
      majoring in artificial intelligence. I am currently working as an intern
      at Google, which is the same company that my father works for. Last year I
      worked on implementing a system that allows technicians to manage their
      workflows when repairing and replacing machines in Google's datacenters.
      This year, all my work will be open source and can be found at
      <a href="https://github.com/avagarcia0">my GitHub</a>. My interests
      include computer science, video games, and social choice theory.
      </p>
      <p>
      One cool concept in social choice theory is Voter Satisfaction Efficiency,
      or VSE for short. VSE is intended to act as a holistic measure of how well
      a voting method does at satisfying voter's preferences. However, because
      it is hard to get data from real-life elections and even harder to read
      people's minds to get their preferences, VSE is measured through simulated
      elections. The following is a graphic showing VSE results for a set of
      simulations conducted by Jameson Quinn:
