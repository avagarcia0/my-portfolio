      <h1>Ava Garcia's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Ava Garcia and I am a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon who is
      majoring in artificial intelligence. I am currently working as an intern
      at Google, which is the same company that my father works for. My
      interests include computer science, video games, and social choice theory.

      One cool concept in social choice theory is Voter Satisfaction Efficiency,
      or VSE for short. VSE is intended to act as a holistic measure of how well
      a voting method does at satisfying voter's preferences. However, because
      it is hard to get data from real-life elections and even harder to read
      people's minds to get their preferences, VSE is measured through simulated
      elections. The following is a graphic showing VSE results for a set of
      simulations conducted by Jameson Quinn:
